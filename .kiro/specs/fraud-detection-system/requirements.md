# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves building a comprehensive fraud detection system for financial transactions. The system will analyze transaction patterns from a simulated financial dataset containing 30 days of transaction data (744 time steps) to identify fraudulent activities. The dataset includes various transaction types (CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER) and aims to detect fraudulent agents who take control of customer accounts to empty funds through transfers and cash-outs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to load and explore the fraud detection dataset, so that I can understand the data structure and transaction patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads the dataset THEN it SHALL successfully read the CSV file containing transaction data
2. WHEN the dataset is loaded THEN the system SHALL display basic statistics about the data (number of records, transaction types, time range)
3. WHEN exploring the data THEN the system SHALL show the distribution of transaction types and amounts
4. WHEN analyzing the data THEN the system SHALL identify missing values and data quality issues
5. WHEN examining fraud patterns THEN the system SHALL show the ratio of fraudulent to legitimate transactions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to preprocess and clean the transaction data, so that it's suitable for machine learning model training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preprocessing data THEN the system SHALL handle missing values appropriately
2. WHEN cleaning data THEN the system SHALL encode categorical variables (transaction types, customer names)
3. WHEN preparing features THEN the system SHALL create derived features from existing columns (balance changes, transaction ratios)
4. WHEN scaling data THEN the system SHALL normalize numerical features for model training
5. WHEN splitting data THEN the system SHALL create training and testing datasets with proper stratification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to build and train fraud detection models, so that I can accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building models THEN the system SHALL implement multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
2. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques
3. WHEN validating models THEN the system SHALL use cross-validation to assess performance
4. WHEN evaluating models THEN the system SHALL calculate precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics
5. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL identify the best performing model based on evaluation metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to visualize fraud patterns and model performance, so that I can understand the effectiveness of the fraud detection system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visualizing data THEN the system SHALL create charts showing transaction distributions by type and amount
2. WHEN analyzing fraud patterns THEN the system SHALL display fraud occurrence by transaction type and time
3. WHEN showing model performance THEN the system SHALL create confusion matrices and ROC curves
4. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL generate feature importance plots
5. WHEN creating dashboards THEN the system SHALL provide interactive visualizations for exploration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a fraud analyst, I want to analyze specific fraud patterns and risk factors, so that I can understand how fraudulent activities occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing fraud patterns THEN the system SHALL identify high-risk transaction types
2. WHEN examining customer behavior THEN the system SHALL detect unusual balance changes
3. WHEN investigating transfers THEN the system SHALL flag large transfers (>200,000) as per business rules
4. WHEN analyzing time patterns THEN the system SHALL identify fraud occurrence patterns over time
5. WHEN profiling customers THEN the system SHALL distinguish between customer and merchant account patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy and monitor the fraud detection model, so that it can be used in production for real-time fraud detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the model THEN the system SHALL save the trained model for future use
2. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL provide real-time fraud scoring for new transactions
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track model accuracy over time
4. WHEN handling new data THEN the system SHALL retrain the model periodically
5. WHEN alerting stakeholders THEN the system SHALL generate notifications for high-risk transactions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to generate reports on fraud detection performance, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and system effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create summary statistics of detected fraud cases
2. WHEN documenting performance THEN the system SHALL track false positive and false negative rates
3. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL show fraud detection trends over time
4. WHEN creating audit trails THEN the system SHALL log all fraud detection decisions
5. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL provide reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel)
